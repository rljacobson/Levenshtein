    This testcases file has been adapted from:

    Iosifovich - A blazingly fast and efficient Levenshtein distance function.

    Created by Frederik Hertzum on 18 June 2018.

    18 January 2019 - Robert Jacobson:
        * Refactored build system to use CMake.
        * Used std::mismatch with the reverse iterators rbegin/rend to find common suffix.
        * Added transpositions.
        * The function now  takes two `string_view`'s instead of `string`'s
        * Preallocated the buffer

    19 January 2019 - Robert Jacobson:
        * Implemented a common early bailout optimization: If the caller only cares about edit distance less than k, we only need to look at the range i - k <= j <= i + k, and if the min of values in that range is >= k, we return k (or infinity).

    21 January 2019 - Frederik Hertzum:
        * Relicensed under the MIT license.

    21 January 2019 - Robert Jacobson:
        * Actually, more is true. One can actually restrict attention only to the range i - k/2 <= j <= i + k/2

    30 July 2019 - Robert Jacobson:
        * Adapted to the Levenshtein MySQL UDF implementation.
